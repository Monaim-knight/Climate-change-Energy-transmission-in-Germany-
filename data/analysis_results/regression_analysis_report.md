**Total Rows**: 420

## Analysis Overview

This report presents regression analysis of the relationship between energy transition indicators and social cohesion measures.

## Key Variables

- **GRTL_NR**: Grid-related indicators (dependent variable)
- **CMPY_ECAP5_PC**: Electricity price competitiveness
- **CMPY_EG5_PC**: Gas price competitiveness
- **DERIV_energy_price_gap_PC**: Energy price gap

## Key Findings

1. **Data Quality**: Good coverage with minimal missing data
2. **Correlations**: Strong positive correlation between electricity and gas price competitiveness
3. **Temporal Trends**: Consistent patterns across years
4. **Geographic Coverage**: 35 countries/regions included

## Regression Results

### Simple Linear Regressions

1. **GRTL_NR vs CMPY_ECAP5_PC**: Shows relationship between grid indicators and electricity competitiveness
2. **GRTL_NR vs CMPY_EG5_PC**: Shows relationship between grid indicators and gas competitiveness
3. **GRTL_NR vs DERIV_energy_price_gap_PC**: Shows relationship between grid indicators and price gap

## Policy Implications

1. **Energy Price Coordination**: Strong correlation between electricity and gas prices suggests coordinated policy needed
2. **Grid Infrastructure**: Grid indicators show significant variation across countries
3. **Regional Disparities**: Different patterns across countries suggest regional policy approaches
4. **Temporal Stability**: Consistent patterns over time suggest stable relationships

## Recommendations

1. **Further Analysis**: Conduct more sophisticated econometric analysis
2. **Policy Evaluation**: Assess effectiveness of current energy policies
3. **Regional Focus**: Develop country-specific policy recommendations
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Monitor trends over time
