## 📝 Literature Review Draft

### Chapter 2: Literature Review

#### 2.1 Introduction

The relationship between energy transitions and social cohesion has emerged as a critical area of research as countries worldwide pursue ambitious climate goals and renewable energy targets. Germany's Energiewende, one of the most ambitious energy transitions globally, provides a unique opportunity to examine how large-scale energy system transformation affects social cohesion, community resilience, and social equity. This literature review examines the theoretical foundations, empirical evidence, and research gaps in understanding social cohesion during energy transitions, with particular focus on the German context.

The review is organized into five main sections. First, we examine the theoretical foundations of social cohesion and energy justice, establishing the conceptual framework for analysis. Second, we review empirical studies on social impacts of energy transitions, focusing on social acceptance, community engagement, and social vulnerability. Third, we analyze the German Energiewende context, examining its social dimensions and regional variations. Fourth, we explore regional and spatial analysis of energy transitions, focusing on geographic disparities and spatial justice. Finally, we examine policy and governance approaches to energy transitions, focusing on social compensation mechanisms and participatory approaches.

#### 2.2 Theoretical Foundations

##### 2.2.1 Social Cohesion Theory

Social cohesion has been defined in multiple ways across different disciplines, but common elements include social connectedness, shared values, trust, and collective action capacity (Chan et al., 2006). Putnam (2000) emphasizes the importance of social capital, including networks, norms, and trust, for community resilience and collective action. Woolcock (2001) distinguishes between bonding social capital (within groups) and bridging social capital (between groups), both of which are important for social cohesion.

In the context of energy transitions, social cohesion becomes particularly relevant as communities face significant changes in their energy systems, economic structures, and social relationships. Social cohesion can both facilitate and be affected by energy transitions, creating complex feedback loops that require careful analysis.

##### 2.2.2 Energy Justice Framework

Energy justice has emerged as a key framework for analyzing the social dimensions of energy systems and transitions. Sovacool and Dworkin (2015) identify three dimensions of energy justice: distributional justice (who gets what), procedural justice (who participates), and recognition justice (who is acknowledged). Jenkins et al. (2016) expand this framework to include restorative justice (how to address past injustices) and cosmopolitan justice (global implications).

The energy justice framework provides useful tools for analyzing how energy transitions affect different social groups and communities. Distributional justice concerns the fair distribution of energy benefits and burdens, while procedural justice focuses on participation in energy decision-making. Recognition justice addresses the acknowledgment of different ways of knowing and being in energy systems.

##### 2.2.3 Just Transition Concept

The concept of just transition, originally developed by labor unions, has been expanded to address broader social concerns in energy transitions. A just transition ensures that the shift to a low-carbon economy is socially equitable, protecting workers and communities while creating new opportunities for sustainable development.

Just transition principles include social dialogue, social protection, economic diversification, and community participation. These principles are particularly relevant for analyzing social cohesion during energy transitions, as they address the social dimensions of energy system transformation.

#### 2.3 Social Impacts of Energy Transitions

##### 2.3.1 Social Acceptance of Renewable Energy

Social acceptance has been identified as a crucial factor in the success of renewable energy projects and energy transitions more broadly. Wüstenhagen et al. (2007) identify three dimensions of social acceptance: socio-political acceptance (general support for renewable energy), community acceptance (local support for specific projects), and market acceptance (consumer willingness to adopt renewable energy technologies).

Research has shown that social acceptance is influenced by multiple factors, including perceived benefits and costs, trust in institutions, community participation, and procedural justice. Devine-Wright (2005) emphasizes the importance of moving beyond simple NIMBY explanations to understand the complex social and psychological factors that influence public perceptions of renewable energy.

##### 2.3.2 Community Energy and Social Capital

Community energy projects have been identified as a potential mechanism for enhancing social cohesion and social capital during energy transitions. Ohlhorst and Tews (2015) examine community energy projects in Germany, finding that local ownership and participation can enhance both social cohesion and renewable energy adoption.

Community energy projects can create local economic benefits, increase social capital, and enhance community resilience. However, they also require significant social capital and community capacity to be successful. The relationship between community energy and social cohesion is complex and context-dependent.

##### 2.3.3 Energy Poverty and Social Vulnerability

Energy transitions can create new forms of social vulnerability, particularly for low-income households and vulnerable groups. Bouzarovski and Petrova (2015) examine energy poverty globally, finding that it affects 10-15% of European households and is concentrated among vulnerable groups.

Middlemiss and Gillard (2015) emphasize that energy vulnerability is multidimensional and dynamic, involving not just income but also social support, housing quality, and access to information and services. Energy transition policies can either exacerbate or alleviate energy poverty, depending on their design and implementation.

#### 2.4 German Energy Transition Context

##### 2.4.1 Energiewende Overview

Germany's Energiewende represents one of the most ambitious energy transitions globally, aiming to achieve 80% renewable energy by 2050 and complete phase-out of nuclear power by 2022. Morris and Pehnt (2016) provide a comprehensive analysis of the Energiewende, examining its social, economic, and environmental impacts.

The Energiewende has transformed Germany's energy system, with renewable energy share increasing from 6% in 2000 to over 40% in 2020. However, this transformation has not been without social challenges, including rising energy costs, regional disparities, and social equity concerns.

##### 2.4.2 Social Dimensions of Energiewende

The social dimensions of the Energiewende have been complex and multifaceted. On one hand, the transition has created new economic opportunities, particularly in renewable energy sectors and community energy projects. On the other hand, it has also created new challenges, including rising energy costs and regional disparities.

Community energy projects have been particularly important in Germany, with over 1,000 energy cooperatives established since 2000. These projects have demonstrated that local ownership and participation can enhance both social cohesion and renewable energy adoption.

##### 2.4.3 Regional Disparities

The Energiewende has created significant regional disparities in Germany, with some regions becoming energy exporters while others remain dependent on external energy sources. Klagge and Schmole (2019) examine these regional disparities, finding that rural areas have generally benefited more from renewable energy development than urban areas.

Regional policy differences also affect energy transition outcomes, with some states implementing more ambitious renewable energy targets and support mechanisms than others. These regional differences have implications for social cohesion and social equity.

#### 2.5 Regional and Spatial Analysis

##### 2.5.1 Geographic Disparities

Energy transitions create new forms of geographic inequality, with some regions benefiting from renewable energy development while others face new challenges. Spatial analysis of energy transitions reveals complex patterns of winners and losers across different geographic scales.

Urban-rural differences are particularly important, with rural areas often having more opportunities for renewable energy development but also facing different social and economic challenges. These geographic disparities can affect social cohesion both within and between regions.

##### 2.5.2 Spatial Justice

Spatial justice concerns the fair distribution of energy benefits and burdens across different geographic areas. Energy transitions can create new forms of spatial injustice, particularly when renewable energy development is concentrated in certain regions while energy consumption occurs elsewhere.

Addressing spatial justice in energy transitions requires attention to both procedural justice (who participates in energy decision-making) and distributional justice (who benefits from energy development). This is particularly relevant for Germany, where renewable energy development has been unevenly distributed across regions.

#### 2.6 Policy and Governance

##### 2.6.1 Energy Transition Governance

The governance of energy transitions is crucial for their social outcomes. Jacobsson and Lauber (2006) examine the politics and policy of energy system transformation, finding that policy design is crucial for social outcomes and that participatory governance enhances social acceptance.

Effective energy transition governance requires attention to both technical and social dimensions, ensuring that policies address social concerns while achieving environmental and economic goals. This requires coordination across multiple levels of government and stakeholder engagement.

##### 2.6.2 Social Compensation Mechanisms

Social compensation mechanisms are necessary to address the social costs of energy transitions and ensure broad social support. Lauber and Jacobsson (2016) examine these mechanisms, finding that they must go beyond simple financial compensation to address broader social concerns.

Effective social compensation mechanisms include community benefits, social protection measures, and long-term social investments. These mechanisms are particularly important for vulnerable groups and communities that may be disproportionately affected by energy transitions.

#### 2.7 Research Gaps and Theoretical Framework

##### 2.7.1 Identified Research Gaps

This literature review reveals several important research gaps in understanding social cohesion during energy transitions. First, there is limited empirical analysis of how energy transitions affect social cohesion, particularly in the German context. Second, there is limited longitudinal analysis of social cohesion changes over time. Third, there is limited analysis of regional differences in social cohesion during energy transitions. Fourth, there is limited analysis of how different policies affect social cohesion. Finally, there is limited analysis of how energy transitions affect social cohesion among vulnerable groups.

##### 2.7.2 Theoretical Framework for Analysis

Based on this literature review, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing social cohesion during energy transitions that integrates social cohesion theory, energy justice frameworks, and just transition principles. This framework addresses the identified research gaps and provides a foundation for empirical analysis.

The framework emphasizes the multidimensional nature of social cohesion, the importance of energy justice in energy transitions, and the need for just transition approaches that address social equity concerns. It also highlights the importance of regional analysis and policy evaluation in understanding social cohesion outcomes.

#### 2.8 Conclusion

This literature review has examined the theoretical foundations, empirical evidence, and research gaps in understanding social cohesion during energy transitions, with particular focus on the German context. The review reveals that while there is growing recognition of the social dimensions of energy transitions, there are significant gaps in empirical analysis of social cohesion outcomes.

The German Energiewende provides a unique opportunity to address these gaps, offering a rich context for analyzing how large-scale energy transitions affect social cohesion, community resilience, and social equity. The theoretical framework developed in this review provides a foundation for empirical analysis that can contribute to both academic understanding and policy development.

The next chapter will present the methodology for analyzing social cohesion during Germany's energy transition, building on the theoretical framework developed in this literature review and addressing the research gaps identified.
