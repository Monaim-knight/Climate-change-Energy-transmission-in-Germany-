## ðŸŽ¯ Detailed Research Questions

### Primary Research Questions

#### 1. Main Research Question
**How does Germany's energy transition affect social cohesion, and what factors contribute to social inclusion or exclusion in this process?**

#### 2. Social Inequality and Energy Transition
- **RQ1.1**: Does energy transition exacerbate existing social inequalities in Germany?
- **RQ1.2**: Which demographic groups (age, income, education, location) are most vulnerable to energy transition impacts?
- **RQ1.3**: How do energy costs and access patterns correlate with social trust and community engagement?

#### 3. Regional Disparities and Spatial Justice
- **RQ2.1**: How do regional differences in renewable energy adoption affect social cohesion?
- **RQ2.2**: What are the spatial patterns of energy justice in Germany's energy transition?
- **RQ2.3**: How do urban vs. rural areas differ in their social response to energy transition?

#### 4. Public Perception and Trust
- **RQ3.1**: What role does public perception and trust play in the success of energy transition policies?
- **RQ3.2**: How do different social groups perceive energy transition policies and their impacts?
- **RQ3.3**: What factors influence public acceptance of renewable energy projects?

#### 5. Policy Effectiveness and Social Compensation
- **RQ4.1**: How effective are current social compensation mechanisms in mitigating negative social impacts?
- **RQ4.2**: What policy approaches best maintain social cohesion during energy transitions?
- **RQ4.3**: How can energy transition policies be designed to enhance rather than undermine social cohesion?

### Secondary Research Questions

#### 6. Long-term Social Implications
- **RQ5.1**: What are the long-term social implications of different energy transition pathways?
- **RQ5.2**: How do social cohesion patterns change over the course of energy transition?
- **RQ5.3**: What are the intergenerational effects of energy transition on social cohesion?

#### 7. Comparative and International Context
- **RQ6.1**: How do German experiences compare with other European countries' energy transitions?
- **RQ6.2**: What lessons can be learned from successful energy transition cases?
- **RQ6.3**: How do EU-level policies affect national social cohesion in energy transitions?

### Specific Hypotheses to Test

#### H1: Social Inequality Hypothesis
- **H1a**: Energy transition policies disproportionately burden low-income households
- **H1b**: Educational attainment moderates the relationship between energy transition and social cohesion
- **H1c**: Rural areas experience greater social disruption from energy transition than urban areas

#### H2: Regional Disparity Hypothesis
- **H2a**: Regions with higher renewable energy adoption show greater social cohesion
- **H2b**: Energy transition creates new forms of regional inequality
- **H2c**: Spatial proximity to renewable energy infrastructure affects social attitudes

#### H3: Policy Effectiveness Hypothesis
- **H3a**: Social compensation mechanisms reduce negative social impacts of energy transition
- **H3b**: Participatory policy design enhances social acceptance of energy transition
- **H3c**: Transparent communication about energy transition benefits improves social cohesion

#### H4: Temporal Dynamics Hypothesis
- **H4a**: Social cohesion initially decreases but recovers over time during energy transition
- **H4b**: Early adopters of renewable energy show different social cohesion patterns than late adopters
- **H4c**: Economic benefits of energy transition eventually outweigh social costs
