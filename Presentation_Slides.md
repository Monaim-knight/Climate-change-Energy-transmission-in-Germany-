# Bridging Divides: Social Cohesion and Energy Transition — 10-Slide Deck

1) Title & Team
- Project title, author, affiliation
- Aim: Link energy transition to social cohesion in Germany/EU

2) Motivation & Research Questions
- Why social cohesion matters in energy transition
- RQs: market integration, disparities, temporal trends, implications

3) Data & Preparation
- Eurostat energy indicators; derived master dataset
- Cleaning, harmonization, quality checks

4) Methods Overview
- Descriptives, simple regressions, temporal trends
- Constraints: standard library only (no pandas)

5) Descriptive Highlights
- 35 countries, 12 years; missingness 8.8–11.2%
- Germany highest grid indicator (GRTL_NR)

6) Regression & Correlations
- Weak negative associations of prices with GRTL_NR
- Strong electricity–gas price correlation (≈ 0.893)

7) Temporal Trends
- Prices improved (competitive) from 2013–2024
- Grid indicators steadily increased; stabilization at high levels

8) Interpretation
- Strong market integration; significant regional disparities
- Stable trends suggest policy continuity and incremental success

9) Policy Implications
- Short-term: EU coordination, targeted investments, local assistance
- Medium-term: energy justice, citizen engagement, policy transfer
- Long-term: energy democracy, innovative governance, global cooperation

10) Next Steps & Q&A
- Expand social cohesion data and controls; causal and spatial models
- Implementation roadmap for policy & research
- Q&A
