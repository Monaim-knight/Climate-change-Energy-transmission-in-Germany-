\begin{abstract}
This study examines the relationship between energy transition indicators and social cohesion-relevant structures across 35 European countries from 2013-2024. Using Eurostat energy market data, we analyze electricity and gas price competitiveness, grid infrastructure indicators, and derived energy price gaps. Our analysis reveals strong market integration (correlation = 0.893 between electricity and gas prices), significant regional disparities in grid infrastructure (Germany leads with GRTL\_NR = 953.5), and consistent temporal trends indicating policy effectiveness. Despite limitations in direct social cohesion measures, our findings suggest that coordinated energy policies, targeted infrastructure investment, and regional approaches are essential for maintaining social cohesion during energy transitions. The study provides evidence-based policy recommendations for EU energy coordination, regional development, and social equity frameworks.

\section{Introduction}

Germany's energy transition (Energiewende) represents one of the most ambitious climate policy initiatives globally, aiming to achieve carbon neutrality while maintaining economic competitiveness and social cohesion. However, the rapid transformation of energy systems raises critical questions about social equity, regional disparities, and community resilience \citep{burkhardt2019, hake2015}.

The relationship between energy transition and social cohesion remains underexplored in the literature, particularly regarding how energy market integration, infrastructure development, and pricing mechanisms affect social structures and community well-being. This study addresses this gap by examining energy transition indicators across 35 European countries and their implications for social cohesion.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Energy Transition and Social Cohesion}

Energy transitions fundamentally alter social structures through changes in employment patterns, community organization, and resource distribution \citep{heffron2021}. Social cohesion, defined as the bonds that hold societies together, encompasses structural factors (infrastructure, economic opportunities), relational factors (trust, shared identity), and institutional factors (policy legitimacy, participation) \citep{chan2006}.

The energy justice literature emphasizes three dimensions: distributive justice (equitable access to energy services), procedural justice (participation in energy decisions), and recognition justice (acknowledgment of different needs and values) \citep{jenkins2016}. These dimensions directly relate to social cohesion, as unequal access to energy services can exacerbate social divisions.

\subsection{Market Integration and Regional Disparities}

European energy market integration, driven by EU directives and market liberalization, has created both opportunities and challenges for social cohesion. While integrated markets can promote efficiency and reduce costs, they may also create winners and losers across regions \citep{newbery2018}.

Regional disparities in energy infrastructure development reflect historical, economic, and political factors that influence social cohesion. Areas with advanced grid infrastructure may experience greater economic opportunities and community resilience, while lagging regions face increased vulnerability \citep{monstadt2009}.

\section{Data and Methods}

\subsection{Data Sources}

We utilize Eurostat energy market indicators from the \texttt{estat\_nrg\_ind\_market} dataset, covering 35 European countries from 2013-2024. The dataset includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CMPY\_ECAP5\_PC}: Electricity price competitiveness indicator
\item \textbf{CMPY\_EG5\_PC}: Gas price competitiveness indicator  
\item \textbf{GRTL\_NR}: Grid-related infrastructure indicator
\item \textbf{DERIV\_energy\_price\_gap\_PC}: Derived energy price gap measure
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Preparation}

Data cleaning and harmonization followed established protocols:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Conversion from TSV to CSV format with standardized column names
\item Geographic harmonization using NUTS classification
\item Temporal harmonization to annual data
\item Missing value treatment and quality assessment
\item Construction of derived indicators
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Analytical Methods}

Due to technical constraints (pandas installation issues), we implemented custom analysis using Python's standard library:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Descriptive Statistics}: Mean, standard deviation, min/max for all variables
\item \textbf{Correlation Analysis}: Pearson correlation coefficients between key variables
\item \textbf{Simple Linear Regression}: Bivariate relationships using least squares estimation
\item \textbf{Temporal Analysis}: Trend analysis across the 12-year period
\item \textbf{Visualization}: ASCII-based charts and SVG figures for publication
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Descriptive Statistics}

\input{tables/table_descriptives}

The dataset contains 420 observations across 35 countries and 12 years. Missing data rates range from 8.8\% to 11.2\% across key variables, indicating good data quality. Germany exhibits the highest grid infrastructure levels (GRTL\_NR = 953.5), while other countries show significant variation.

\subsection{Market Integration Analysis}

\input{tables/table_correlations}

The correlation matrix reveals strong market integration, with electricity and gas price competitiveness showing a correlation of 0.893. This suggests highly coordinated energy markets across Europe, supporting theories of market liberalization and integration.

\subsection{Regression Analysis}

\input{tables/table_regressions}

Bivariate regressions show weak but consistent relationships between energy price indicators and grid infrastructure. All relationships are negative, suggesting that higher energy price competitiveness (lower prices) is associated with higher grid infrastructure levels.

\subsection{Regional Disparities}

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{assets/fig_tile_grid_map_grtl.svg}
\caption{Tile Grid Map: Mean GRTL\_NR by Country}
\label{fig:grid_map}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:grid_map} illustrates significant regional disparities in grid infrastructure. Germany leads with the highest values, followed by Italy and other Western European countries. Eastern and Southern European countries generally show lower levels, indicating uneven energy transition progress.

\subsection{Temporal Trends}

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Germany GRTL\_NR Time Series (2013-2024)}
\label{fig:germany_trends}
\end{figure}

Germany's grid infrastructure shows steady growth from 2013-2017, then stabilization at high levels. This pattern suggests successful policy implementation and technology adoption.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{assets/fig_top_countries_grtl.svg}
\caption{Top 10 Countries by Mean GRTL\_NR}
\label{fig:country_comparison}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:country_comparison} confirms Germany's leadership in grid infrastructure development, with significant variation across countries.

\subsection{Correlation Analysis}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{assets/fig_correlation_heatmap.svg}
\caption{Correlation Heatmap of Key Variables}
\label{fig:correlation_heatmap}
\end{figure}

The correlation heatmap confirms strong positive correlation between electricity and gas prices, moderate correlation between price gap and electricity prices, and weak negative correlations between grid indicators and price measures.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Market Integration and Policy Implications}

The strong correlation between electricity and gas price competitiveness (r = 0.893) indicates highly integrated European energy markets. This integration suggests that energy policies should be coordinated at the EU level to ensure effectiveness and avoid unintended consequences.

\subsection{Regional Disparities and Social Cohesion}

Significant regional variation in grid infrastructure development raises concerns about energy justice and social cohesion. Germany's leadership in grid development may create advantages that other regions cannot match, potentially exacerbating social divisions.

\subsection{Temporal Stability and Policy Success}

Consistent trends over the 12-year period suggest that current energy transition policies are effective and should be continued. The stabilization of Germany's grid indicators at high levels indicates successful technology adoption and policy implementation.

\section{Limitations and Future Research}

\subsection{Current Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
\item No direct social cohesion measures in the dataset
\item Correlational analysis without causal identification
\item Limited to European countries
\item Technical constraints limiting advanced statistical methods
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Integrate social cohesion indicators (trust, participation, equity measures)
\item Add control variables (GDP, population, political factors)
\item Implement causal analysis methods (instrumental variables, natural experiments)
\item Extend to global scale with international comparisons
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

This study provides evidence of strong energy market integration, significant regional disparities, and consistent temporal trends in European energy transitions. While direct social cohesion measures are limited, the analysis reveals important patterns that inform policy recommendations for maintaining social cohesion during energy transitions.

The findings suggest that coordinated energy policies, targeted infrastructure investment, and regional approaches are essential for promoting social cohesion. Future research should integrate direct social cohesion measures and implement advanced causal analysis methods to provide more definitive policy guidance.
