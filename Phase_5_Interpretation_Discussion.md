## 1. Theoretical Interpretation of Key Findings

### 1.1 Energy Price Relationships and Market Integration

**Finding**: Strong correlation (r = 0.893) between electricity and gas price competitiveness across 35 countries.

**Theoretical Interpretation**:
- **Market Integration Theory**: The strong correlation suggests that European energy markets are highly integrated, with coordinated pricing mechanisms
- **Energy Justice Framework**: Uniform price movements may indicate systemic rather than country-specific factors driving energy costs
- **Social Cohesion Implications**: Integrated markets could either promote solidarity (shared challenges) or create resentment (perceived unfairness in price-setting)

**Literature Connection**:
- Aligns with EU energy market integration policies (Directive 2009/72/EC)
- Supports theories of energy market liberalization and its social impacts
- Contradicts expectations of national energy sovereignty in pricing

### 1.2 Regional Disparities in Grid Infrastructure

**Finding**: Significant variation in GRTL_NR values, with Germany (953.5) far exceeding other countries.

**Theoretical Interpretation**:
- **Energy Justice Theory**: Unequal grid development creates "energy poverty" and infrastructure gaps
- **Social Cohesion Theory**: Infrastructure disparities may reinforce existing social and economic divides
- **Transition Theory**: Germany's leadership reflects early adoption of renewable energy policies

**Literature Connection**:
- Supports "just transition" literature emphasizing equitable infrastructure development
- Aligns with theories of "energy democracy" and citizen participation
- Contradicts assumptions of uniform EU energy transition progress

### 1.3 Temporal Trends and Policy Effectiveness

**Finding**: Consistent decline in energy prices (2013-2024) alongside steady increase in grid indicators.

**Theoretical Interpretation**:
- **Policy Feedback Theory**: Declining prices may reflect successful renewable energy policies
- **Social Learning Theory**: Increasing grid indicators suggest successful technology adoption
- **Coalition Theory**: Stable trends indicate broad political support for energy transition

**Literature Connection**:
- Supports theories of policy learning and adaptation
- Aligns with "green growth" narratives
- Contradicts "energy transition as crisis" perspectives
